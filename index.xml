      <title>A Multipath Extension to the QUIC Module for ns-3</title>

      <description>S. Shu, W. Yang, J. Pan and L. Cai, &amp;quot;A Multipath Extension to the QUIC Module for ns-3,&amp;quot; 2023 Workshop on ns-3 (WNS3), Arlington, VA, USA, 2023, pp. 608-615, doi: 3592149.3592803
Abstract: Network transmission with multiple interfaces is desirable for the next-generation Internet to improve end-to-end performance and reliability. Multipath QUIC is thus proposed to utilize multiple interfaces for Internet transmission with QUIC, while QUIC is already standardized and active in use by several mainstream web browsers.</description>

      <description>W. Yang, L. Cai, S. Shu and J. Pan, &amp;quot;Scheduler Design for Mobility-aware Multipath QUIC,&amp;quot; 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2022, pp. 2849-2854, doi: 10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001247.
Abstract: The Integrated Terrestrial and LEO satellite network (ITSN) is promising for providing ubiquitous communication services. In ITSN, network mobility brings new challenges and attracts attention. In this paper, we promote a new transport layer protocol, Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) to deal with the network mobility issue in ITSN.</description>

      <title> A Multipath Extension to the QUIC Module in ns-3</title>
      <link>https://ssjshirley.github.io/publications/mpquic_talk/</link>

      <description>Network transmission with multiple interfaces is desirable for the next-generation Internet to improve end-to-end performance and reliability. Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) is proposed to utilize multiple access links and paths for non-interrupted Internet transmission building upon QUIC, a newly standardized transport layer protocol. The lightning talk will describe the current effort to develop a multipath extension to the QUIC module in ns-3. This extension has the scalability of multiple paths, the flexibility of the path schedulers, and the extensibility of the congestion control algorithms, providing a stable simulation platform for the research community on multipath transport layer protocols.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUIC) Protocol</title>
      <link>https://ssjshirley.github.io/publications/quic_talk/</link>

      <description>QUIC, which stands for Quick UDP Internet Connections, is a transport layer protocol developed by Google. It was designed to improve the performance of web communication and address some of the limitations of the traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). QUIC operates over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead of TCP, which allows for faster and more efficient data transmission.
QUIC was initially developed to enhance the performance of web applications, particularly for mobile devices and real-time communication.</description>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>
